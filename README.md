**PREDICT RESTURANT RATING**

Objective1: Build a machine learning model to predict theaggregate rating of a restaurant based on other features.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing values,encoding categorical variables, and splitting the datainto training and testing sets.
Select a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression,decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.
Evaluate the model's performance using appropriateregression metrics (e.g., mean squared error, R-squared)on the testing data.
Interpret the model's results and analyze the mostinfluential features affecting restaurant ratings.

**Cuisine Classification**

Objective: Develop a machine learning model toclassify restaurants based on their cuisines.
Steps:
Preprocess the dataset by handling missing valuesand encoding categorical variables.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Select a classification algorithm (e.g., logisticregression, random forest) and train it on thetraining data.
Evaluate the model's performance usingappropriate classification metrics (e.g., accuracy,precision, recall) on the testing data.
Analyze the model's performance across differentcuisines and identify any challenges or biases.

**Location-based Analysis**

Objective: Perform a geographical analysis of the
restaurants in the dataset.
Steps:
Explore the latitude and longitude coordinates of the restaurants and visualize their distribution on a map.
Group the restaurants by city or locality and analyze the concentration of restaurants in different areas.
Calculate statistics such as the average ratings, cuisines, or price ranges by city or locality.
Identify any interesting insights or patterns related to the locations of the restaurants.
